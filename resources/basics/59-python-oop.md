# Python Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)

## What is OOP?

OOP stands for Object-Oriented Programming. It's a programming paradigm that allows you to structure code using classes and objects for better organization and reusability.

## Advantages of OOP

- Provides a clear structure to programs
- Makes code easier to maintain, reuse, and debug
- Helps keep your code DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)
- Allows building reusable applications with less code

> "The DRY principle means you should avoid writing the same code more than once."

## Core Concepts: Classes and Objects

### What are Classes?
A class defines the blueprint or template for creating objects. It specifies what an object should look like and contain.

### What are Objects?
Objects are instances of a class, created based on the class definition.

#### Example Comparison

| Class | Possible Objects |
|-------|-----------------|
| Fruit | Apple, Banana, Mango |
| Car   | Volvo, Audi, Toyota |

## Key Takeaways

When an object is created from a class, it inherits:
- All variables defined in the class
- All functions (methods) defined in the class

## Next Steps in Learning OOP

In subsequent chapters, you'll learn how to:
- Create a class
- Create objects
- Access class members
- And explore more advanced OOP concepts

The tutorial suggests that Python is inherently an object-oriented language, making it well-suited for implementing OOP principles.

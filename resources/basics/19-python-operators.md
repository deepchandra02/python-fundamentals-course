# Python Operators Tutorial

Python operators are used to perform operations on variables and values. They are divided into several groups:

## Arithmetic Operators
Perform mathematical operations:
- `+` Addition: `x + y`
- `-` Subtraction: `x - y`
- `*` Multiplication: `x * y`
- `/` Division: `x / y`
- `%` Modulus: `x % y`
- `**` Exponentiation: `x ** y`
- `//` Floor division: `x // y`

## Assignment Operators
Assign values to variables:
- `=` Simple assignment: `x = 5`
- `+=` Add and assign: `x += 3` (equivalent to `x = x + 3`)
- `-=` Subtract and assign
- `*=` Multiply and assign
- `/=` Divide and assign
- Other compound assignment operators like `%=`, `//=`, `**=`

## Comparison Operators
Compare two values:
- `==` Equal to
- `!=` Not equal to
- `>` Greater than
- `<` Less than
- `>=` Greater than or equal to
- `<=` Less than or equal to

## Logical Operators
Combine conditional statements:
- `and` Returns True if both statements are true
- `or` Returns True if one statement is true
- `not` Reverses the result

## Identity Operators
Compare object identity:
- `is` Returns True if objects are the same
- `is not` Returns True if objects are different

## Membership Operators
Test for membership in a sequence:
- `in` Returns True if value is in the sequence
- `not in` Returns True if value is not in the sequence

## Bitwise Operators
Perform operations on binary numbers:
- `&` AND
- `|` OR
- `^` XOR
- `~` NOT
- `<<` Zero fill left shift
- `>>` Signed right shift

## Operator Precedence
Operators are evaluated in a specific order, with parentheses having the highest precedence. The general order from highest to lowest includes:
1. Parentheses
2. Exponentiation
3. Multiplication, Division, Modulus
4. Addition, Subtraction
5. Comparison operators
6. Logical operators

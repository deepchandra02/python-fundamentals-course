# Python Tuple Looping

Python provides multiple ways to loop through tuples:

## 1. Basic For Loop
```python
thistuple = ("apple", "banana", "cherry")
for x in thistuple:
    print(x)
```
This method directly iterates through each item in the tuple.

## 2. Looping Using Index Numbers
```python
thistuple = ("apple", "banana", "cherry")
for i in range(len(thistuple)):
    print(thistuple[i])
```
Uses `range()` and `len()` to access tuple items by their index.

## 3. While Loop
```python
thistuple = ("apple", "banana", "cherry")
i = 0
while i < len(thistuple):
    print(thistuple[i])
    i = i + 1
```
Loops through tuple items by manually tracking the index.

### Key Points:
- For loops are the most straightforward method
- Index-based loops give more control over iteration
- While loops provide flexibility in iteration logic
- `len()` function helps determine tuple length
- Indexing starts at 0 in Python

Each method allows you to access and process tuple elements systematically.

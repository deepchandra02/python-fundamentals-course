# Python - Join Tuples

## Join Two Tuples

In Python, you can join two tuples using the `+` operator. Here's an example:

```python
tuple1 = ("a", "b", "c")
tuple2 = (1, 2, 3)

tuple3 = tuple1 + tuple2
print(tuple3)
```

This code concatenates `tuple1` and `tuple2` into a new tuple `tuple3`.

## Multiply Tuples

You can also multiply the content of a tuple a given number of times using the `*` operator:

```python
fruits = ("apple", "banana", "cherry")
mytuple = fruits * 2

print(mytuple)
```

This example creates a new tuple by repeating the `fruits` tuple twice.

### Key Points:
- Use `+` to join two or more tuples
- Use `*` to repeat a tuple's contents multiple times
- These operations create a new tuple without modifying the original tuples

The tutorial demonstrates simple and intuitive ways to combine and manipulate tuples in Python.

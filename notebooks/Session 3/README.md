## üéì Teaching Best Practices

### Before the Session
1. **Test all notebooks** yourself
2. **Have backup plan** for installation issues
3. **Prepare enthusiasm** - this is exciting content!
4. **Set expectations** - it's okay to struggle initially

### During the Session
1. **Live code along** - don't just watch students
2. **Encourage questions** - ML can be intimidating
3. **Celebrate small wins** - first array, first plot, first prediction
4. **Show mistakes** - debugging is part of learning
5. **Manage time strictly** - 30 min for MNIST is non-negotiable

### Code-Along Style
- **Type along** with students (don't copy-paste)
- **Explain as you type** - narrate your thinking
- **Make intentional mistakes** occasionally (then fix them)
- **Ask prediction questions** - "What will this output?"
- **Encourage experimentation** - change numbers, try things

### Pacing Strategies
- **Fast start** (NumPy) - they already know Python
- **Moderate middle** (Pandas/Matplotlib) - new concepts
- **Engaging finish** (ML project) - the exciting part!

### Energy Management
- **High energy for MNIST** - this is the wow factor
- **Build suspense** - "Want to build AI? Let's go!"
- **Use analogies** - make complex simple
- **Show enthusiasm** - your excitement is contagious

## What is Python? 🐍

### Why Python is Awesome

- **Simple, readable syntax** - like writing in English
- **Versatile** - web development, data science, automation
- **Beginner-friendly** - perfect for learning programming
- **Powerful** - used by Google, Netflix, Instagram

### Your First Python Program

```python
print("Hello, World!")
```

---

## Print Function Basics 📝

### The `print()` Function

- **Displays text** on the screen
- **Basic syntax**: `print("your message here")`
- Uses **quotes** for text (strings)

### Examples

```python
print("Hello, World!")
print("Welcome to Python!")
print("🧮 Calculator App Starting...")
```

---

## Comments in Python 💬

### Why Use Comments?

- **Explain your code** to others (and future you!)
- **Document what your program does**
- **Temporarily disable code** during testing

### Comment Syntax

```python
# This is a single-line comment
print("Hello!")  # Comment at end of line

# You can use multiple lines
# to explain complex concepts
print("Welcome to my calculator!")
```
